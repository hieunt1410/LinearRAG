    "468:. others felt the overtly religious reference infringed their rights. the leader of the people ’ s empowerment party, natalio d. wheatley, said there was a \" glaring problem \" with the pledge : that it is \" oxymoronic \" to refer to a territory as a country. the use of the capitalised term \" territory \" suggests the word is part of the territory's name when it's not. grammatically, the reference to \" these virgin islands \" rather than \" the virgin islands \" at the end of the pledge renders the pledge ungrammatical when recited outside the territory. there was little public engagement concerning the wording of the pledge before its adoption. the graduation pledge of social and environmental responsibility has been offered since 1987 at colleges and universities throughout the united states and the world. the pledge states : \" i pledge to explore and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job i consider and will try to improve these aspects of any organizations for which i work. \" the purpose of the pledge is to encourage graduating students to be mindful of the social and environmental impacts of their employment as they enter the workforce or continue their education. it is up to students to define for themselves what socially and environmentally responsible means. over one hundred universities and colleges as well as some high schools use the pledge to some extent. there are several different types of schools involved, including the following : students who voluntarily sign the pledge seek out employment that reflects their values, sometimes turning down jobs with which they do not feel comfortable. others work to make changes after they are on the job. some examples include promoting recycling at their workplace, removing discriminatory language from training materials, working for gender equality in athletics, and helping to convince employers to reject contracts that would clearly have negative impacts on society or the environment. the pledge was first established at humboldt state university, california, in 1987. manchester university in indiana hosted the effort from 1996 to 2007, at which time bentley university near boston became the host. the project takes shape in different ways depending on the institution. at some colleges, for example, students sign wallet - sized cards with the pledge written on them that they can keep as a reminder of the commitment they've made. some institutions put the pledge into the formal program for their commencement ceremonies. at other institutions, pledge signers wear green ribbons or green tassels at commencement to signify their commitment ( some schools use a different color of ribbon ). at bentley university the pledge is a \" capstone \" of its four - year civic leadership program and at humboldt state university, the student government funds a student pledge coordinator internship. the pledge serves to promote social and environmental responsibility on three different levels : students and alumni who are making choices about employment ; schools including values and citizenship in their curriculum as opposed to just knowledge and skills ; and the workplaces and wider society being concerned about issues beyond just the bottom line. the graduation pledge alliance maintains a web site for campus organizers and those who have signed the pledge. the pledge protection act is proposed legislation in the united states congress that seeks to deprive all federal courts, including the supreme court, of jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges to the pledge of allegiance or its recitation. the bill was first introduced in response to a constitutional challenge to the pledge by atheist michael newdow. tuggeranong creek, a partly perennial stream of the murrumbidgee catchment within the murray - darling basin, is located in the tuggeranong district of canberra, within the australian capital territory, australia. \" tuggeranong \" is derived from the aboriginal word, meaning \" cold plain \". the traditional custodians of the land surrounding tuggeranong creek are the aboriginal people of the ngunnawal tribe. cloudy peak is a mountain summit located in the glacier peak wilderness of the north cascades, in chelan county of washington state. its nearest higher peak is north star mountain, to the northeast. precipitation runoff from cloudy peak drains into agnes creek and railroad creek, both tributaries of the chelan river. northkill creek is a stream primarily located in berks county, pennsylvania. it feeds into tulpehocken creek and covers part of the schuylkill river and delaware river watersheds. northkill creek and its tributaries are high quality trout streams. route r4 is a main cross - city bus route in canberra, australia operated by action between belconnen, city, woden town centre and tuggeranong. moredun creek is a river of the state of new south wales in australia. deerfield is an unincorporated community in deerfield township, steele county, minnesota, united states, near medford and owatonna. the community is located along nw 66th street near nw 73rd avenue. mackenzies creek and mud creek both flow nearby. lake tuggeranong, an artificial lake sourced the confluence of tuggeranong",
