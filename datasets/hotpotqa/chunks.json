typically raised for no reason. many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification. additionally modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the real estate chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate united states laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the note holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the mortgage crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the real estate market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds. while such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008. the market relied heavily on consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the usa government provided justice through president obamas inception and irs inception of modifications which addressed these unethical profits in reals estate. it was in 2009 that harp, hamp and modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of note holders. taking on the banks that ran usa government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made america great again as justice for consumers reigned. legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in state code of law and federal law on precedent cases that are available to the public. finally, it had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.888 7th avenue is a

    "74:(from amharic: , also transliterated as pentay or pente) is an amharic and tigrinya language term for a christian of a protestant denomination, widely used in ethiopia and among ethiopians and eritreans living abroad. the term was coined in the late 1960s and was used as a pejorative for churches that believed in the pentecostal experience. today, it is used to describe local protestant christians who are not members of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo and eritrean orthodox tewahedo churches. the term \"p'ent'ay\" is a shortening of the word \"pentecostal\"; however, it is widely used when referring to all protestant christians whether they are actual pentecostals or not. some orthodox will also apply the term to the small catholic population of ethiopia. the equivalent rendition in many other languages is evangelicals. the four major evangelical denominations in ethiopia are: the kale heywet (word of life); mekane yesus (place of jesus), lutheran; mulu wongel (full gospel) and meserete kristos (meaning \"christ foundation\") or mennonite. some p'ent'ay communities - especially mekane yesus - have been influenced by the orthodox tewahedo church, which represents mainstream, traditional ethiopian christianity. but for the most part they are very pentecostal in their worship and theology.herbert s. lewis (born may 8, 1934) is professor emeritus of anthropology at the university of wisconsin-madison, where he taught from 1963 to 1998. he has conducted extensive field research. in ethiopia, lewis studied both the history of the oromo (galla) kingdom of jimma abba jifar and the lives of contemporary oromos from 1958–60 and in 1965–66. (many of his ethnographic photographs are visible in the university of wisconsin's digital library. see the link to africa focus below). his work in ethiopia was concerned above all with political leadership and community organization as well as ethnohistory and culture history. the book, originally titled a galla monarchy: jimma abba jifar, ethiopia, 1830-1932, is a study of the nature of the monarchy, the sources of the ruler's power, as well as its origins. the study in 1965-66 centered on community life and the leadership of spirit mediums, k'allu, who effectively organized religious life and conflict resolution, and provided a degree of political leadership for rural districts.the second battle of agordat was fought in late december 1893, between italian colonial troops and mahdists from the sudan. emir ahmed ali campaigned against the italian forces in eastern sudan and led about 10–12,000 men east from kassala. this force encountered 2,400 italians and their eritrean askaris at agordat, west of asmara, commanded by colonel arimondi. over 1,000 dervishes, including the emir, were killed in severe fighting. the outcome of the battle constituted:the treaty of addis ababa, signed 23 october 1896, formally ended the first italo–ethiopian war on terms mostly favorable to ethiopia. this treaty superseded a secret agreement between ethiopia and italy negotiated days after the decisive battle of adwa in march of the same year, in which ethiopian forces commanded by menelik ii defeated the italians. the most important concession the italians made was the abrogation of the treaty of wuchale and recognizing ethiopia as an independent country.ethiopia–japan relations are the international relations between ethiopia and japan. both were nations with an ancient history which successfully repulsed european military advances to dominate them, ethiopia at the battle of adwa, and japan at the battle of tsushima, and as a result both nations considered each other potential allies prior to world war ii.the first italo-ethiopian war was fought between italy and ethiopia from 1895 to 1896. it originated from a disputed treaty which, the italians claimed, turned the country into an italian protectorate. italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members germany and austria. much to their surprise, they found that ethiopian ruler menelik ii, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the italian army, invading ethiopia from italian eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected. in addition, ethiopia was supported by russia, an orthodox christian nation like ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale",

(the named defendant is bernard d. rostker, director of the selective service system.) in a 6-3 decision, the supreme court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the act would stand as passed.the 16 september military parade in honour of the anniversary of mexican independence is an annual tradition dating back to the late 19th century and the beginning of the professionalisation of the mexican armed forces in the 20th century. held yearly in the zócalo in mexico city, this parade, the largest of the various parades held simultaneously nationwide on september 16, mexican independence day, is presided by the president of mexico in the fulfillment of his duty as the supreme commander of the armed forces. it is also attended by members of the cabinet of mexico, the congress of the union, civil service employees, the secretaries of national defense and navy, members of the mexican armed forces and federal police, uniformed service veterans, the state diplomatic corps, delegations representing the religious sector, indigenous peoples, sports and the private sector, and the general public. seen on tv and the internet and heard on radio, this is one of the biggest events of the year. taking part in this are members of the mexican armed forces and the federal police.pepsico, inc. is an american multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation headquartered in purchase, new york. pepsico has interests in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products. pepsico was formed in 1965 with the merger of the pepsi-cola company and frito-lay, inc. pepsico has since expanded from its namesake product pepsi to a broader range of food and beverage brands, the largest of which included an acquisition of tropicana products in 1998 and the qu",
